 Personalized Plant Care and Tracking:

Data for Recommendations

Maintain a small reference dataset for plant needs (optimal temperature, watering frequency, soil type, etc.).
Map user’s location/climate (api_userprofile) to that dataset.
Example: If climate_zone = "Tropical", suggest “water daily in hot seasons,” or “use organic fertilizer X.”
Tracking & Reminders

Create a Plant Tracking model/table (e.g. user_id, plant_id, last_watered, next_watering_due, notes).
Let users update growth logs (height, health status, any pests observed).
Use a simple approach for reminders: store next_task_date in each record and show upcoming tasks on the dashboard.
Alerts & Notifications

If maintenance_reminders or pest_alerts is true, show an alert or send an email.
You can expand this later with Celery or cron jobs to automate sending reminders.
Frontend Integration

On the user’s “Profile” or “My Plants” page, display recommended care steps (pulled from your reference dataset + user’s climate info).
Show upcoming tasks, e.g. “Next watering due in 2 days.”
Future Enhancements

Add an AI/ML layer to refine recommendations.
Integrate external weather APIs to adjust watering schedules automatically.
